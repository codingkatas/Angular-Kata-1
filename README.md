Kata 1
======

Create a HTML 5 table with AngularJS and Twitter bootstrap

To start, you install Maven and JBoss v. 7.x.
Se further instructions on the site http://[path/to/katasite]

In this kata, you must create a table using the "ng-repeat" directive.
The table should be styled using twitter bootstrap.

There is a controller which provides a short list of data for the kata.
The name is "kata1.home.HomeController".

For instructions in how to start, consult the AngularJS website.
Also, to style the table correct, check the twitter bootstrap website.

For both, use google to find them :-)

When you are are ready, there is a link in the bottom of the page, which you can click to test your skills :-)
